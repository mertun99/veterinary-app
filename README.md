## 📋 Description

This project is a full-stack, web-based application written in **Python**, with **JavaScript** and **SQL** (via the CS50 library). It also includes an additional standalone Python program.

The web application is built for a general veterinary clinic. It provides essential information for clients—services, contact details, and clinic background—along with an **online appointment reservation system**.

The main layout and styling are implemented using the **Bootstrap** framework. Some components are customized using the `custom.css` file, which overrides default Bootstrap styles such as colors.

## 📦 Dependencies  

All dependencies are listed in **`requirements.txt`**.

---

## ⚙️ app.py  

The main application file containing the core logic and route definitions.  
It features **9 main routes**:

- `/` – Index (homepage)  
- `/services`

- `/appointments`  
- `/map`  
- `/admin` – Login (default: `admin` / `admin`)  
- `/logout`

- **`/logout`** ends the session for staff users.

## 🗃️ vet_clinic.db  

This SQLite database includes two primary tables:

1. **`admins`** – Stores usernames, IDs, and hashed passwords
